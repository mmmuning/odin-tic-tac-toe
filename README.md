# TIC TAC TOE

This project is part of The Odin Project’s JavaScript course. It’s a simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game designed to practice DOM manipulation, module patterns, and interactive gameplay logic using JavaScript.

## This project includes:

- A 3x3 game board where two players can place markers (X and O)
- Optional player name inputs to personalize the game
- Game logic to check for wins, ties, and alternating turns
- Visual feedback for winning cells and a modal to show results
- A restart button to reset the game

## Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Creating modular JavaScript using the Module Pattern
- Manipulating the DOM to render dynamic game elements
- Handling user input and events with forms and buttons
- Implementing game logic including win/tie conditions and turn switching
- Managing application state with JavaScript objects and functions
- Structuring HTML and CSS for interactive, responsive interfaces
